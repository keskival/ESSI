ESSI language is a stack based byte code language designed to be easily transpiled into assembly.

ESSI language was designed by the course staff in TUT, and is not mentioned anywhere in the internet.

I have a firm belief that all copyrights are my own, but if you know differently, because it's a long time ago, please tell me.

These files are put here for the purposes of recording and storing computing history. This serves only purposes of curiosity.

I made a text based adventure game in that stack-based byte code also, adventure.essi.

I don't have means to compile or run this anymore, because I don't have access to SPARC hardware.
